#OK so this needs to do a couple of things
# Number onely, it needs to SCAN when airplanes come IN and LOG that time.
# TWOsely, it needs to SCAN when airplanes go OUT and log THAT time. Calculate the time between.
# We could have a discord bot that alerts us when delays reach 15 minutes & a "DROP" command for people who disconnect or whatevs. 
# Or it could "scan" to see if they're still connected and auto-drop that way.

# 3, when local scans flight strip, it needs to transmit that data (plus visual/not visual) to a80 AND check to see if theres a timer running for the aircraft. 
# if so, stop that timer and see what the delay is.
